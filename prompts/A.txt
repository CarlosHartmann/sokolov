In the following text, try to see if you can find the antecedent of the pronoun "they". If it is impossible to know the antecedent from the text alone, answer "antecedent outside". Otherwise, simply state the following two informations:

1) the antecedent of the pronoun, either quoting it from the text or, if it is inferable via context, naming or describing it.

Say that it is an "impersonal they" if it is a sentence like "they say fast food is bad for you", where "they" refers to people in general, or vaguely refers to people above/in power. Such an impersonal "they" is often used for creators of TV shows and games, as in "They gave him a bigger role in the second season".

2) if the antecedent is plural or not. There are some difficult cases for this, so follow these rules:

* a company implies many people so it is plural
* an indefinite statement such as "a teacher" is grammatically singular despite potentially talking about many teachers
* words like "everyone", "anyone", "no one" etc also refer to many people but are grammatically singular, hence you should answer singular.
* the impersonal "they" explained above is always plural.

Give your response in the format "The antecedent is [1] and it is [2: singular/plural]". You can add any explanations or clarifications after this sentence in your response in case that it requires context information or reasoning.

Use your general knowledge to infer the antecedents and note that there can be misspellings or other irregularities/errors present in the text.
